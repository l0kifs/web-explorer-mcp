"""
End-to-end tests for webpage_content_tool with GitHub Issues page.

These tests validate the complete functionality of webpage_content_tool by extracting
and verifying real content from GitHub's issue tracking page for microsoft/playwright.

Test coverage:
- Basic content extraction (title, main content, structure)
- Issue list extraction (issue titles, numbers, authors, status)
- User information extraction (usernames/nicknames, profile links)
- Links extraction (issue links, author links, repository links, pagination links)
- Statistics extraction (issue counts, labels, timestamps)
- Metadata extraction (headings, content type)
- Pagination detection (next page, page numbers)

Based on analysis of https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues:
- Page title: "Issues · microsoft/playwright"
- Content type: code repository (GitHub)
- Multiple issues displayed (25 per page by default)
- Issue structure: title, number (#37813, #37812, etc.), author, status, timestamps
- Statistics: Open issues count (548), Closed issues count (15,996)
- User information: Authors' usernames (vladlearns, NazariGamer, cpAdm, etc.)
- Pagination: Next page links, page numbers (1-22), navigation controls
- Headings: H1 "Issues", H2 "Search results", H3 for each issue title

Note: Tests are marked as 'slow' with 60s timeout due to:
- Real network requests to external website (GitHub)
- Playwright browser automation
- Complex page processing with dynamic content
- Large HTML page with many elements

Run individual tests to avoid sequential execution issues:
